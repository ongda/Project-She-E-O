<!--Body: AiTeam photo + bio-->
<ion-content padding>
  <p>AiTeam is a diverse group consisting of six strong women in the engineering and business field.
    The group originated from their in-common workplace SAITS before gathering together with their variety of different major backgrounds to
    build forth on their idea of the LocGo app. The LocGo app was invented due to the first hand experience from the AiTeam group themselves finding the
    convenience need of having an app guiding anyone lost to their seek destination and showing the available utilities in every destination. </p>

  <h5> More About LocGo App </h5>
    <p> The AiTeamâ€™s goal for the LocGo app was for a user friendly base app that will help guide anyone
    lost through the paths they should take to reach their desired destination. AiTeam also wanted to integrate in the app any shops or restrooms
    to better assist the user for just not the need of reaching a certain destination but also the need for other utilities the user may not be
    aware that is provided around them. </p>
